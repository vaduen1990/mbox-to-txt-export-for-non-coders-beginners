# mbox-to-txt-export-for-non-coders-beginners
Python scripts &amp; notes for exporting an MBOX to PDF/TXT, including troubleshooting steps: I have NO background in coding. This workflow (scripts, commands, error notes and final TXT export) is based on asking friends,  researching on GitHub, and using that information to prompt Chat GPT for codes, correcting with user-based knowledge.
